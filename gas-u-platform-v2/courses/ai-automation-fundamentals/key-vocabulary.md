# Lesson 6: Key Vocabulary

## Introduction
As you delve into automation, you'll encounter many new terms. This lesson serves as a glossary to reinforce the key concepts we've covered.

## Core Concepts

**AI Agent**
: An autonomous entity that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve specific goals.

**Environment**
: The world or system in which an AI agent operates. For software agents, this is the digital environment of data, files, and applications.

**Sensor**
: The component an agent uses to perceive or gather information from its environment (e.g., reading a file, checking a website).

**Actuator**
: The component an agent uses to take action and affect its environment (e.g., writing a file, sending an email).

**Goal**
: The specific, predefined objective that the agent is trying to achieve.

**Workflow**
: A series of connected steps (nodes) that, when executed in sequence, accomplish a larger goal. The assembly line for automation.

**Trigger**
: The event or schedule that starts a workflow.

**Node**
: A single action or step within a workflow. Each node performs one specific task.

**Data Mapping**
: The process of connecting data fields from a source node to a target node.

**Data Transformation**
: The process of changing the data itself (e.g., its format, structure, or value).

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
: A set of rules that allows one application to request data or actions from another. This is a "pull" mechanism.

**Webhook**
: A mechanism that allows an application to automatically send (or "push") real-time data to another application when an event occurs.

**Polling**
: The process of checking for new data on a schedule or interval. This is used by schedule-based triggers.
