# Lesson 7: Error Handling

## Introduction
Even the best-designed workflows can fail. An API might be temporarily down, data might be in the wrong format, or a service might be unavailable. **Error Handling** is the process of anticipating these failures and building mechanisms into your workflow to manage them gracefully.

## Why is Error Handling Important?
Without error handling, a workflow will simply stop the moment it hits an error. This can lead to incomplete tasks, lost data, and a lack of visibility into what went wrong. Good error handling makes your automations reliable and trustworthy.

## Common Error Handling Strategies

1.  **Retry on Failure:** Some errors are temporary (e.g., a brief network blip). Many workflow tools allow you to configure a node to automatically retry a few times before failing completely.

2.  **Conditional Logic ("Try/Catch"):** You can build a "try/catch" block using conditional logic.
    *   **Try:** The main action is attempted.
    *   **Catch:** If the main action fails, the workflow follows a different path. This "error path" can then perform a fallback action.

3.  **Fallback Actions:** If a step fails, what should happen next?
    *   **Send a Notification:** The most common fallback is to send an email, Slack message, or SMS to a human to alert them of the problem.
    *   **Use Default Data:** If a node fails to retrieve data, you can provide a default value to allow the rest of the workflow to continue.
    *   **End Gracefully:** Sometimes, the correct action is to simply stop the workflow without causing further issues.

## Conclusion
Error handling transforms a brittle script into a professional-grade automation. Always think about what could go wrong in your workflow and build in a strategy to handle it.
