# Lesson 2: What is a Workflow?

## Introduction

If an AI Agent is a single worker, a **Workflow** is the entire assembly line. It's a series of connected steps and tasks that, when executed in sequence, accomplish a larger goal. In the world of AI and automation, workflows are how you orchestrate multiple agents and tools to perform complex processes.

## Core Components of a Workflow

Most workflow automation platforms (like n8n, Zapier, or Make) share a few core concepts:

*   **Trigger:** This is the event that starts the workflow. It could be a new email arriving, a form being submitted, a file being added to a folder, or simply a set schedule (e.g., every hour).
*   **Nodes (or Steps):** These are the individual actions performed in the workflow. Each node is like a specialized agent that does one specific thing: read a file, send an email, update a database, call an API, etc.
*   **Connections:** These are the lines that connect the nodes, showing the path that the data takes. The output of one node becomes the input for the next.
*   **Data:** As the workflow runs, data flows from node to node. A key skill in building workflows is transforming and mapping this data correctly between steps.

## Example: A Simple Support Ticket Workflow

Imagine a customer submits a support request through a form on your website.

1.  **Trigger:** A "Form Submitted" event.
2.  **Node 1:** An AI agent reads the form data, analyzes the customer's request, and categorizes it (e.g., "Billing", "Technical Support").
3.  **Node 2:** A router sends the data down different paths based on the category. If it's "Billing", it goes to the accounting department. If "Technical Support", it goes to the engineering team.
4.  **Node 3:** An email node sends a notification to the correct team with all the details from the form.

## Conclusion

Workflows are the key to unlocking the true power of automation. By learning to think in terms of triggers, nodes, and data flow, you can automate almost any digital process imaginable.
